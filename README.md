# Docker - Multi Stage Build

This project make use of multi stage build capability to create docker images. 

## Issue with existing docker file:
Initially , certificate is copied into /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/certificates and added to trust store. After this step, there is no need of this certificate. Since there is no way to remove it (Before Docker 17.05), the final image contained unnecessary files.
## Multistage build
In the given problem, we can copy the .pem file which was generated by the command "update-ca-certificates" to the final image. This way, we can ensure that the final image only contains  the files and data which are required at runtime.
